Application Overview
The LEVIATHAN Command Center is designed for users who require maximal execution speed and robust MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) protection for their decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, specifically focusing on complex atomic swaps.

The app simulates the multi-phased lifecycle of a shielded transaction, providing real-time visual feedback, detailed metrics, and a forensic audit trail for every execution attempt.
